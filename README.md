 # Google data analytics capstone project
 * Dataset: Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius)
 * Software: Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Excel, Power BI
## Key task
Analyze smart device usage data and use the insights for the growth of our new hypothetical company Bellabeat. 
## Insights
* The dataset contained one month of data from 12 April 2016 to 1 May 2016.
* All users tracked steps, distance, calories, and physical activity. 72% of them tracked activity. 42% tracked heart rate and only 24% provided weight info.
* Users slept almost 7 hours daily, mostly between 11 pm and 6 am.
* Users were mostly active from 5 pm to 8 pm and from 12 pm to 2 pm.
* Users recorded nearly 20 hours daily, out of which they were inactive 81% of the time.
* ## Recommendations
* Users are inactive most of the day. Bellabeat should organize health campaigns and present this data to encourage users to track their activity and maintain a 
  healthier lifestyle.
* Since most users track only physical activity, production should be done accordingly and more information should be collected about why or why not users track 
  sleep or heart rate.
* Bellabeat should advertise the benefits of tracking heart rate and sleep.
* Advertisement timings should be early morning around 8 am to 10 am or 8 pm to 10 pm.
